# Mailing-List-Cleaner

This is a mailing list cleaner designed to work with my company's mailing list import template.

Historically, we would have to:

  - Remove all duplicate contacts
  - Remove all empty values
  - Format all columns so they are title cased
  - Format contact first/last names
  - Make sure all emails are lower cased
  - Add country codes to each individual country (France: FR, America: US)
  - Delete and trailing/leading white spaces

The cleaning process could sometimes take hours, split between a few members of the team for one list.

This app takes all the hard work out of the cleaning and let's the team reinvest their time into more important tasks!
