# Mailing-List-Cleaner

This is a mailing list cleaner that works with my company's mailing list import template.

Historically, we would have to:
  - Remove all duplicate contacts
  - Remove all empty values
  - Format all columns so they are title cased
  - Add country codes to each country (France: FR, America: US)
  - Delete white spaces

The cleaning process could take hours at times, split between a few members of the team for one list.

This app takes all the hard work out of the cleaning and let's the team reinvest their time in more important tasks!
